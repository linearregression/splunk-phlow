In our design we use the Splunk Deployment Server to manage the apps that reside on both the INDEXER and the Universal forwarder

In the root of the phlow-app folder we have two applications.

These are deployment-apps.   One is for the indexer 'splunk-phlow' the other is for the universal forwarder 'splunk-phlow-inputs'


# ALL INDEXERS
[serverClass:all_indexer]
whitelist.0 = <indexer name> 
whitelist.1 = <indexer name> 
[serverClass:all_indexer:app:splunk_phlow]
blacklist.0 = <SERVER = things you don't want on indexer or non-indexers>

################ Universal Forwarder only

### SPLUNK-PHLOW 
[serverClass:splunk-phlow]
whitelist.0 = <universal forwarder name>
restartSplunkd = true
[serverClass:syslog:app:splunk_phlow_inputs]
